# Implemented Fuctions
-m test mode is ready to use

# Test Mode
Test mode pulls all data availble form yahoo finance and checks my algorithum agianst it.
- the '-g' command gets data in the form of a csv file and stores it in the /Data/ folder
- the '-ls' command lists all the csv files you have availible
- the '-t' command tests the algo over the course of a csv files history for 10 day SMA's, WMA's, and EMA's against 25 day and 100 day SMA's
  -(I plan to impement more complex algo's or test for optimal moving averages later)
